Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

**HTML Images Syntax**<br>
In HTML, images are defined with the <img> tag.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image:<br>
img src="url"

**The alt Attribute**<br>
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:<br>
img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania"
</p>
<p>
**Image Size - Width and Height**<br>
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.<br>

img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;"
