Problem Domain:-
Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming.
Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain.
It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question. It’s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.
You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

# Tables:- ———————————-

The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.)
Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (The td stands for table data.)
The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)
The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects:- ———————————-

Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and document loaded into browser window.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets(and both can contain the other).
We can change the value of object properties after coling it.
